# Is your birthday in PI?

Have you ever wondered if the digits of your birthday are contained somewhere
in pi? If you a true nerd you have. 

This repository contains a text file of pi to 1 million decimal places and a 
python script file that collects your birthday and looks for it in the 
first 1 million decimal places of pi. The script provides a table that displays 
all the ways the digits of your birthday appear.
